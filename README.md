## Overview
I worked with a team of three other students to take apart a <b>Dell System Unit</b> and identify its hardware components. After reassembling the PC, we booted the computer using the <b>Ubuntu</b> operating system. This process was documented using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> in the project files. The purpose of this project was to mainly exhibit our interests and become more familiar with basic computer hardware.

## Assembly Preview
The videos in the [`Videos`](Videos) directory outline the assembly procedure. The .mp4 and .wmv files in this directory are tracked using <b>Git LFS</b> due to size restrictions.</i> We have embedded a low resolution compressed version of one of these files below.
