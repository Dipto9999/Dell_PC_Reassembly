	                        <!--This part of the document contains the description of Kshitij.-->
							<h3 class= "names">Kshitij</h3>
								<p class= "description">Among the team members is Kshitij, who is the most youthful and most joyful person to ever come across.
								In spite of his carefree nature, Kshitij is a helpful asset and one of the most brilliant minds of today. Kshitij is generally
								an optimistic thinker who works to "get the job done", as he says. In fact, Kshitij's iQ is estimated to be 190; beyond that of
								even Albert Einstein's! However, he is also a bit weak at pure willpower and requires a great amount of motivation. He relies on liberal methods when problems should arise. This had been expected to produce tremendous results,
								but only time shall tell.</p>
								
							<!--This part of the document contains the description of Yaqoub.-->
							<h3 class= "names">Yaqoub</h3>
								<p class= "description">Yaqoub is the eldest in the team. He is immensely wise due to his past of incredible failures and feats. 
								Yaqoub assists his team as a remarkable problem analyzer and solver. He is believed to be strictly conservative and claims that 
								the only way to get the job done is through analyzing. "Put enough pressure on a person and if they're the right person, they will defy their limits to conquer 
								their struggles." is Yaqoub's most renowned quote to date. </p>
								
							<!--This part of the document contains the description of Muntakim.-->
							<h3 class= "names">Muntakim</h3>
								<p class= "description">Muntakim is warm-hearted and caring towards his partners. To avoid his teammates from being overwhelmed by their
								work, he puts work before sleep to discover the solutions to their problems. The rest of the Space Monkeys are certain he is someone not to be overlooked in terms of pure ability.
								He utters few words but is noticeably taking notes of even the smallest of situations. Through countless hardships, Muntakim has proven to be a loyal 
								and committed member of the Space Monkeys. </p>
								
							<!--This part of the document contains the description of Ashfi.-->
							<h3 class= "names">Ashfi</h3>
								<p class= "description">As the leader of the Space Monkeys, Ashfi utilizes his and his partners' strengths to overcoming any and 
								every obstacle they are faced with. Ashfi is talented at discovering ability in people, in which he has been named the Person of the Year by People Magazine three consecutive years in a row! 
								This allowed him to pick Kshitij, Muntakim, and Yaqoub to join his cadet team. He noticed they have immense capabilities, but they have just as 
								many restraints to their complete freedom of knowledge and discovery. Ashfi is known for his bravery and wit, used when facing the direst of situations. He is known to never hold back and take anything for granted. 
								Ashfi is the receiver of 9 Nobel Peace Prizes and is on his way to even more achievement along with the Space Monkeys.</p>
