							<h3>2014-11-21 1:30 PM (EST)</h3>
								<!--The following list contains the description for work done in class on the day specified.-->
								<ol>
									<li class= "border"><b>Ashfi & Kshitij:</b> They attempted to set up the cables and turn on the computer to download & display the Word file from <a href= "http://touque.ca/EC/"><em><i>http://touque.ca</i></em></a>.</li>
									<li class= "border"><b>Muntakim & Yaqoub:</b> They set up the google account to upload and update the pages of the website. This allowed us to display pages that are being worked on to the <a href= "http://ics2o7-keras.wikispaces.com/"><em>class wiki</em></a>, with the use of <a href= "https://www.google.com/drive/"><em>Google Drive</em></a>. They also assisted Ashfi & Kshitij to connect the various cables, the mouse, and the keyboard to the monitor and system unit.</li>
								</ol>

								<h4 class= "Noted_Information">Notes:</h4>
									<!--The following list contains additional notes on the work done on the specific day.-->
									<ol>
										<li class= "Noted_Information"><em>The computer failed to turn on, leading us to believe there was an issue with the system unit. After switching the system unit with another one, we tried a second attempt. The second system unit failed to boot up as well. This step of the procedure should be done by the next class, which is on the 24th of November.</em></li>

								<!--The following list contains the description for work done in class on the day specified.-->
								<ol>
									<li class= "border"><b>Work Done Together:</b> We attempted to set up the computer and turn it on to download & display the Word file from <a href= "http://touque.ca/EC/"><em>http://touque.ca</em></a> once again.</li>
									<li class= "border"><b>Muntakim & Yaqoub:</b> They discussed and planned the story for the project, which will involve a space station & a team of space cadets called the Space Monkeys. They edited the template and added their information from work done separately to the website. In order to do so, the Cascading Style Sheets had to be modified. </li>
									<li class= "border"><b>Muntakim & Kshitij:</b> They went to go obtain a functioning system unit. Many photos were taken during the trip. *They have Ms. Keras as eye witness.*</li>
									<li class= "border"><b>Ashfi & Kshitij:</b> They had major roles in checking that the system unit and monitor is working. They overcame the challenge of downloading the Word File from <a href= "http://touque.ca/EC/"><em>http://touque.ca</em></a>.</li>
									<li class= "border"><b>Yaqoub:</b> He discovered a <a href= "ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_desktop/esuprt_optiplex_desktop/optiplex-gx240_service%20manual_en-us.pdf"><em>website</em></a> which has descriptions of several Dell system unit models. This assisted Ashfi in gathering the information about specifications and hardware components.</li>
									<li class= "border"><b>Muntakim:</b> He wrote a story for the project, which was decided against and scrapped. He wrote short descriptions of characters in the new story, using his ideas from his previous one. This was added to the webpage titled Crew. He took a great number of photos.</li>

									<li class= "border"><b>Muntakim:</b> He used the dialogue written by Yaqoub to begin writing a plot for his story.

								<ol>
									<li class= "border"><b>Muntakim & Yaqoub:</b> They looked for errors within the website and abolished the use of the marquee element after consulting with Ms. Keras. This was done since it is distracting and diverts the attention of whoever accesses the website. It is also unsupported by HTML5.</li>																
									<li class= "border"><b>Ashfi:</b> He put the clips together over the weekend and added background music to the video. The footage was sped up 3 times the original speed.
